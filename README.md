Colorcards is a plugin for WordPress that provides Shortcodes used to style posts and pages. The styles are designed to work well with the Parchment Paper theme and are geared toward making extremely long content more readable and less off-putting. This is mainly done by partitioning sections into a collapsible accordion.  

Although this current effort targets WordPress, the CSS and JS is applicable elsewhere.  

JavaScript, although not required, is used to allow sections to auto-un-collapse when navigated to by a target hash in the URL. Section's collapse states do not effect each other (you can have more than one open at a time) and with (soon-to-be) optional jQuery the states will be saved across user session via cookies.
